The "Code Helper Chatbot" is a Python-based chatbot designed to assist users in resolving coding-related issues and answering programming-related questions. It provides an interactive interface to help users with common programming tasks and questions.

## Introduction

Hello! I'm chatGUDDU, your friendly programming assistant. I was designed by Sir Vishu to help you with your Python coding needs. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, I'm here to assist you whenever you get stuck with your Python code. I'm constantly being updated to provide even better support.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with me.

## Usage
- When you run the chatbot, I'll greet you and ask for your name.

- You can ask me questions about Python programming or request code examples.

- If you need help with common programming tasks, you can choose from the following options:

1. Check ODD or EVEN
2. Check PRIME
3. Check LEAP year
4. Find FACTORIAL
5. Print FIBONACI series
6. Check ARMSTRONG number
   
- I'll provide you with code examples for your chosen task to help you in your coding journey.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the chatbot:

    chatGUDDU: "Hii! What's your good name?"
    User: "Alice"
    chatGUDDU: "Nice talking to you, Alice! Are you facing trouble in programming? Do you need some help? (Y/N)"
    User: "Y"
    chatGUDDU: "Here's what I have for you..."
    
(User selects an option, e.g., "Check ODD or EVEN?")
